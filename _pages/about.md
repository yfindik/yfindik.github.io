Hi! I'm a Ph.D. Candidate in Computer Science at the University of Massachusetts Lowell, affiliated with the Persistent Autonomy and Robot Learning ([PeARL](https://www.pearl-robotics.com/)) lab. 

My research interests broadly lie in multi-agent reinforcement learning, robotics, and continual learning. I design novel algorithms for guiding effective and robust multi-agent collaboration. 

Before moving to the US for my Ph.D. in 2021, I was a machine learning engineer at CicekSepeti and SoftTech in Turkey, my home country. I am trained as a computer scientist and engineer, holding a master's degree in Computer Science and Engineering from Sabanci University (2018) and a bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering from Izmir Institute of Technology (2016).

Besides work, I hike, bike, play chess, strum my acoustic guitar, and pretend to understand quantum physics.
